## Prompt

```text
# 📜 constitution.md
## Todo In-Memory Python Console App
**Spec-Driven · Agentic · Zero Manual Coding**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Constitution

This constitution defines **non-negotiable rules**, **development constraints**, and **quality standards** for the Todo In-Memory Python Console Application.

Its purpose is to ensure:
- Absolute adherence to **spec-driven development**
- Correct usage of **Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus**
- Clean, maintainable, and testable Python code
- Zero ambiguity during planning, implementation, and review
- No deviation from the defined scope or workflow

This document is the **highest authority** in the repository.
If any file, plan, or instruction conflicts with this constitution, **this constitution takes precedence**.

---

## 2. Development Philosophy

### 2.1 Agentic Dev Stack (Mandatory)

The project **must** follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow **without exception**:

1. **Write Specification** (Spec-Kit Plus)
2. **Generate Plan** from the specification
3. **Break Plan into Atomic Tasks**
4. **Implement Tasks via Claude Code**
5. **Iterate only through spec updates**

❌ Manual coding is **strictly forbidden**
❌ Skipping phases is **not allowed**

All code must be:
- Generated by **Claude Code**
- Traceable back to a **specification file**
- Justifiable via a **documented plan**

---

## 3. Scope Definition

### 3.1 Project Type

- Console-based Todo application
- In-memory data storage only
- No persistence (no files, no DB, no cache)
- Python-only execution

### 3.2 Explicit Non-Goals

The following are **explicitly forbidden**:
- Databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- File storage (JSON, CSV, TXT)
- Web frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django)
- GUIs or TUI frameworks
- Authentication or user accounts
- External APIs

---

## 4. Functional Requirements (Must Be Complete)

The application **must implement all five basic features**:

### 4.1 Add Task
- Accepts:
  - Title (required)
  - Description (optional)
- Assigns a **unique numeric ID**
- Default status: **Incomplete**

### 4.2 View Tasks
- Lists **all tasks**
- Displays:
  - ID
  - Title
  - Description
  - Status (Complete / Incomplete)
- Output must be readable and consistent

### 4.3 Update Task
- Update title and/or description
- Task identified **only by ID**
- Must gracefully handle invalid IDs

### 4.4 Delete Task
- Deletes task by ID
- Must confirm existence before deletion

### 4.5 Mark Complete / Incomplete
- Toggle task completion state
- Status change must be visible when listing tasks

---

## 5. Technical Stack (Strict)

The following stack is **mandatory and exclusive**:

| Tool | Requirement |
|-----|------------|
| Python | 3.13 or higher |
| Package Manager | UV |
| Code Generation | Claude Code |
| Specifications | Spec-Kit Plus |

No additional tooling may be introduced unless explicitly approved by a spec update.

---

## 6. Project Structure (Non-Negotiable)

The repository **must** follow this structure:

/
├── constitution.md
├── CLAUDE.md
├── README.md
├── specs/
│ ├── 001-initial-spec.md
│ ├── 002-plan.md
│ ├── 003-task-breakdown.md
│ └── history/
│ └── (all previous spec versions)
├── src/
│ ├── init.py
│ ├── main.py
│ ├── models.py
│ ├── services.py
│ └── cli.py

yaml
Copy code

### Structure Rules
- No files outside `/src` may contain application logic
- Each file must have **single responsibility**
- Circular dependencies are forbidden

---

## 7. Code Quality Standards

### 7.1 Clean Code Rules

All generated code must:
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Avoid magic numbers
- Contain docstrings where behavior is non-obvious
- Follow Python PEP-8 standards
- Be readable without comments explaining *what* the code does

### 7.2 Error Handling

- Invalid input must never crash the app
- User-facing errors must be clear and human-readable
- Stack traces must not be shown to users

---

## 8. Console Application Rules

- Application must run using:
uv run python src/main.py

markdown
Copy code
- Menu-driven or command-driven interface is acceptable
- User input must be validated at all entry points
- Output must clearly reflect state changes

---

## 9. Spec-Kit Plus Rules

### 9.1 Specification Authority

- Every feature **must originate from a spec**
- Specs must be versioned and immutable once implemented
- All changes require:
1. New spec file
2. Updated plan
3. Updated task breakdown

### 9.2 Specs History

- All obsolete or superseded specs must be moved to:
specs/history/

yaml
Copy code
- No spec may be deleted

---

## 10. Claude Code Usage Rules

- Claude Code must:
- Generate code only from the approved plan
- Never introduce features not in the spec
- Never refactor without spec approval
- Prompts must be explicit, deterministic, and reproducible
- Any ambiguity must be resolved by **updating the spec**, not guessing

---

## 11. Documentation Requirements

### 11.1 README.md
Must include:
- Project overview
- Setup using UV
- How to run the application
- Example usage

### 11.2 CLAUDE.md
Must include:
- Rules for Claude Code usage
- Prompting conventions
- Spec-first enforcement rules
- "No manual coding" reminder

---

## 12. Acceptance Criteria (Final Gate)

The project is considered **complete and valid only if**:

- ✅ All 5 required features work correctly
- ✅ No manual code edits exist
- ✅ Specs → Plan → Tasks → Code traceability exists
- ✅ Code follows structure and clean code rules
- ✅ App runs without errors using UV
- ✅ Repository contains all required deliverables

Failure to meet **any single criterion** invalidates the submission.

---

## 13. Final Authority Statement

This constitution is **binding**.

No shortcuts.
No assumptions.
No undocumented behavior.

**Spec first. Claude second. Code last.**
```

## Response snapshot

Constitution file has been successfully created at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with the following content:

- Core Principles section with 6 specific principles for the Todo In-Memory Python Console App
- Technical Constraints section defining project scope and required technology stack
- Development Workflow section with project structure requirements and error handling standards
- Governance section establishing the constitution as the highest authority
- Version tracking with version 1.0.0, ratified on 2025-12-31

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created initial constitution file for the Todo In-Memory Python Console App project
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for constitution creation
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with project-specific constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: Plan generation and task breakdown can proceed
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear guidelines for spec-driven development approach
