# Todo In-Memory Python Console App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code must originate from a specification file; No manual coding is allowed; Every feature must be traceable back to a documented specification; The workflow follows: Write Specification → Generate Plan → Break Plan into Tasks → Implement via Claude Code → Iterate only through spec updates.

### II. Agentic Development Stack
The project must follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow without exception: Spec-Kit Plus for specifications, Claude Code for implementation, UV package manager for dependencies, and structured project organization with clear separation of concerns.

### III. In-Memory Data Storage
The application must use in-memory data storage only; No persistence to files, databases, or external storage; All data exists only during runtime; This ensures simplicity and avoids complexity of data persistence layers.

### IV. Console Application Interface
The application must be a console-based interface; No GUI or web frameworks; User interaction through command-line interface; Clear, readable output and input validation at all entry points.

### V. Functional Completeness
The application must implement all five required features: Add Task, View Tasks, Update Task, Delete Task, and Mark Complete/Incomplete; Each feature must work correctly without errors.

### VI. Clean Code Standards
All generated code must follow Python PEP-8 standards; Use clear, descriptive names; Avoid magic numbers; Include docstrings where behavior is non-obvious; Be readable without comments explaining what the code does.

## Technical Constraints

### Project Scope
- Console-based Todo application only
- In-memory data storage only (no files, no DB, no cache)
- Python-only execution
- No external APIs, authentication, or user accounts
- Forbidden: databases, file storage, web frameworks, GUIs

### Required Technology Stack
- Python 3.13 or higher
- UV package manager
- Claude Code for code generation
- Spec-Kit Plus for specifications
- No additional tooling without explicit spec approval

## Development Workflow

### Project Structure Requirements
The repository must follow this exact structure:
```
/
├── constitution.md
├── CLAUDE.md
├── README.md
├── specs/
│   ├── 001-initial-spec.md
│   ├── 002-plan.md
│   ├── 003-task-breakdown.md
│   └── history/
│       └── (all previous spec versions)
├── src/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── main.py
    ├── models.py
    ├── services.py
    └── cli.py
```

Each file must have single responsibility; Circular dependencies are forbidden; No application logic outside of `/src`.

### Error Handling Standards
- Invalid input must never crash the app
- User-facing errors must be clear and human-readable
- Stack traces must not be shown to users
- Graceful handling of invalid IDs and edge cases

## Governance

This constitution is the highest authority in the repository; If any file, plan, or instruction conflicts with this constitution, this constitution takes precedence. All code must be generated by Claude Code, traceable back to a specification file, and justifiable via a documented plan. The project is complete only when all 5 required features work correctly, no manual code edits exist, Specs → Plan → Tasks → Code traceability exists, code follows structure and clean code rules, app runs without errors using UV, and repository contains all required deliverables.
